# About the project

My little version of Radu's [Learn 2D Vectors with JavaScript](https://github.com/gniziemazity/2d-vectors) explanation:

[![Learn 2D Vectors with JavaScript](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nzyOCd9FcCA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzyOCd9FcCA&ab_channel=RaduMariescu-Istodor)

It was a great way to have fun and reinforce my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and its [module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) implementation and [OOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript) abstractions. Also, it was an extraordinary opportunity to be able to work with the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and initial concepts of linear algebra and vectors.
